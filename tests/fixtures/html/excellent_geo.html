        <h1>Complete Guide to Machine Learning: From Basics to Advanced</h1>

        <p>Machine learning is defined as a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. According to a 2024 Gartner report, 85% of enterprises now use some form of machine learning in their operations.</p>

        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
        <p>Machine learning refers to algorithms that improve automatically through experience. The field emerged from pattern recognition and computational learning theory in artificial intelligence.</p>

        <p>As noted by Dr. Andrew Ng, a pioneer in the field, "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed."</p>

        <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>There are three main types of machine learning approaches:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supervised Learning</strong>: Training with labeled data</li>
            <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>: Finding patterns in unlabeled data</li>
            <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Learning through trial and error</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supervised Learning Algorithms</h3>
        <p>Supervised learning means training a model on a labeled dataset. Common algorithms include:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr><th>Algorithm</th><th>Use Case</th><th>Accuracy Range</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td>Linear Regression</td><td>Prediction</td><td>70-95%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Random Forest</td><td>Classification</td><td>80-98%</td></tr>
                <tr><td>Neural Networks</td><td>Complex Patterns</td><td>85-99%</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Unsupervised Learning Applications</h3>
        <p>Unsupervised learning is defined as finding hidden patterns without pre-existing labels. Research by MIT shows that 67% of data science projects utilize unsupervised techniques.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Customer segmentation</li>
            <li>Anomaly detection</li>
            <li>Recommendation systems</li>
            <li>Market basket analysis</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Get Started?</h2>
        <p>Getting started with machine learning requires understanding both theory and practice. Here is a recommended learning path:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Learn Python programming fundamentals</li>
            <li>Study statistics and linear algebra basics</li>
            <li>Practice with scikit-learn library</li>
            <li>Work on real-world projects</li>
            <li>Explore deep learning frameworks</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Industry Applications</h2>
        <p>According to McKinsey Global Institute, machine learning could create $2.6 trillion in value annually in marketing and sales alone.</p>

        <p>Major technology companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have invested over $50 billion in AI research since 2020, demonstrating the strategic importance of this technology.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Machine learning represents one of the most transformative technologies of our era. Organizations that effectively leverage these capabilities gain significant competitive advantages in their respective markets.</p>
